<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Martin — a long-time solution architect, a hands-on builder, and someone who’s currently diving head-first into a new chapter of life and learning. I spent more than three decades designing and shaping IT and telecom solutions, especially in managed services, data center, cloud, network architecture, and enterprise environments. I’ve worked with companies like GDT, NTT America, and T-Systems, helping customers build reliable systems, improve operations, and navigate complex technical landscapes.</p>

<p>Outside of the “big tech” world, I’m a creative at heart. I love woodworking — crafting cutting boards, cabinets, and custom pieces that feel like they have a story. My wife and I live on 36 acres in the Arizona desert, where we’re also building out a custom off-grid Hiker Trailer project. Between solar setups, awnings, wiring diagrams, and desert-proofing everything… let’s just say I enjoy getting my hands dirty and figuring things out.</p>

<p>This year, I started shifting my focus toward new skills, including web development and technical writing. I’m taking the Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy and retraining myself from the ground up — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the whole journey. My goal is to blend my architecture background with writing and web development so I can take on remote contract work, create structured documents like SOWs, and build modern, useful solutions from anywhere.</p>

<p>I’m a big believer in continuous learning. Whether it’s improving my health, picking up new tools, or building something in the shop, I like moving forward. This site is part of that journey — a simple project today, and maybe something bigger tomorrow.</p>
